Before starting with MultiThreading lets have a understanding of MultiTasking.
Executing Sevral task simultaneously is known as multitasking.
Two types of Multitasking we have :
1.Process Based Multitasking:
	Executing Sevral task simultaneously where Each task is a seprate independent Process.
	For Better Understanding Lets discuss a one example.
	1.I am writting the code in any text editor.
	2.Listning the song on the same system
	3.Downloading some content from internert in the same system.
	So all these process are running in my system simultaneously but these are indpendent to 
	each other.
	Such type of multitasking is known as process based multitasking which is suitable for OS level.

2.Thread Based MultiThreading:
	within the same process multiple programs are required to execute simultaneously.
	Each Task is an independent part of the same program such type of multitasking is known as 
	thread based multiptocessing.
